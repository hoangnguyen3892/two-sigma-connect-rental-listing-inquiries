# Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries

This is a competition held by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries) from Feb 2017 to Apr 2017.

In this competition, each team needs to predict predict the number of inquiries a new listing receives based on the listingâ€™s creation date and other features. 

Submissions are evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss.

**Final result**:
- Best score: 0.11565 (rmse)
- Best ranking: 393/4,915
- Personal summary: Even though I tried to implement many different models to see the improvement, the score was not improved that much. The model seems to be overfitting all the time. I guess to improve significantly, the data exploration and processing (outliers removal, dimension reduction and feature creation) should be focused.
- Further step: Check the kernel of leaderboard when they release their methods.
